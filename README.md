# Web Audio Mixer
## About
Web Audio Mixer is an online DJ instrument. It allows you to open audio files from your hard drive and blend them together using a DJ inspired mix board. It is currently live on my website, so you can play with it [here](http://www.tuckerburke.com/Web-Audio-Mixer/).
## Documentation
I created this game for my Interactive Media Development course at RIT. This was my first project assembled in Unity and was coded using C#. The sprites were hand drawn with ink on tracing paper for Inktober. The purpose of the assignment was to utilize vector forces for controls and physics. I recently added a bit more juice and functionality to the prototype to flesh it out as a portfolio piece.
