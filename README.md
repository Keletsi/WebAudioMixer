# Web Audio Mixer
## About
Web Audio Mixer is an online DJ instrument. It allows you to open audio files from your hard drive and blend them using a DJ inspired mix board. It's currently live on my website so that you can play with it [here](http://www.tuckerburke.com/Web-Audio-Mixer/).
## Documentation
I initially created this web application for my Rich Media Web App Development course at Rochester Institute of Technology. It utilizes the web audio api with quite a few nodes, the UI is in HTML, and the canvas output programmed using JavaScript. There are a couple of features I would still like to add, like pitch adjustment and nudge. These additions would allow for beat matching and would complete the tool. Next time around, I would like to create a synthesizer VST plugin.
